JokerMovie was able to be made because it was doable for such a modest budget of only $55 million and as South Africans you realise that's R814000000.00. It's easy to get lost in the all the million dollar numbers going around. ,1

ok ITChapterTwo is pretty good but let's be honest: you can't turn IT into a movie make it a fucking series! they're serialising anything go for the only adaptation possible please.,1
DarkPhoenix was brilliant. SophieTurner brought Jean Grey/Phoenix to life in a way that has never been done in previous films. Thank you to all involved for bringing these wonderful characters/stories to the screen for so many years sad to see this era of X-Men come to an end.,0
I saw UsMovie last night (thank you .JordanPeele) and I left the theater thinking that if my shadow person comes up to claim my life before July I will submit to her with a smile &amp; say “good luck taking the bar exam sewer bitch” ,2
He looks sooooo good here. ITChapter2 ItMovie ITChapterTwo,1
Now that I have had time to process JokerMovie I can say it’s one of the best films of the year. It’s disturbing and twisted but in the best way. 10/10,2
DarkPhoenix Jean Grey begins to develop incredible powers that corrupt and turn her into a Dark Phoenix. Now the X-Men will have to decide if the life of a team member is worth more than all of humanity. I enjoyed watching this movie I give it get tickets ,0

Just got out of DarkPhoenix. I don't know about the rest of you but I liked it. Not the best of the XMen films but certainly not the worst. Sophie Turner's take on the Phoenix was pretty spot on. With Fox's films done I look forward to the MCU take on the X-Men.,0
Oo nga eh. No end credits like all of the X-Men movies did before. But I enjoyed the movie even though there are some critics. DarkPhoenix.,0

I liked CaptainMarvel; it was a fun film. But I freely admit that quality -wise it was mediocre at best. And it was far from the best example of Brie Larson's acting. It's horrifically self-serving to assume that all criticism or dislike is the product of bigotry.,2
Technically you can’t say ITChapterOne is better than ITChapterTwo because it’s supposed to be one long movie.,1

People griping that DarkPhoenix could have been better are missing the point. Marvel has it now. Give them 10yrs &amp; they'll devote an entire Phase to the saga to see it done correctly. Leave Dark Phoenix alone and move on.,0
CatsMovie was good. Not amazing but good enough to watch again. Defo need to read the plot or see the musical beforehand as much of the film needs context in relation to characters and songs. Hands and feet on cats is a no no and their faces need more cat like features. 7/10,0

DarkPhoenix is so average it hurts to see the X-Men go out with such a meh! Some of the action is good but you really won't really care much about anything especially a wasted Jessica Chastain &amp; her bland villains. Time for a fresh start. It's still oddly watchable though! 5/10 ,0
I did it. I saw CatsMovie because I love the friends who suggested it very much and I wanted to see them. I was almost *almost* coping until Idris Elba took off his weird cat coat. And then I genuinely recoiled in horror and started saying no. I can never un-see that.,0

Most interesting tidbit in an otherwise bad movie: when the X-Men are captured in DarkPhoenix their captors are the Mutant Control (I think?) Unit. Or MCU. And when their logo is most visible? The X-Men are pleading to be freed. So they are... and all the MCU die anyway. ,0

CatsMovie is the only musical movie I've ever been intrigued by wanting to watch. I like strongly dislike 95% of musicals I've seen which is usually only a 1/3 of them as most as I have to roll my eyes and stop watching.,0
I'm filled with rage. I mean these seasonal fans who prolly doesn't even watch the previous 21 movies going all pressed and whiny about AvengersEndgame's ending. Understand the previous 21 movies first then you'll be able to grasp what's Endgame really all about.,2

Okay the timeline and time travel and time travel rules in AvengersEndgame were a hot mess of ever changing inconsistent nonsense. I'm trying to over look that detail tho cause generally I did enjoy it,1

CatsMovie is almost perfectly normal quality (only sometimes a bit boring and with very bad CGI) musical. The opinions disappointed me I hoped for a twisted nightmare and none of it was even half as sick as the reviews suggested. Movie critics are just weak losers.,0

“Now this story I’m about to unfold took place just after our conflict with Thanos. I only mention it cuz sometimes there’s a man & I’m talkin’ about Thor here. Even if he’s a lazy man & Thor was certainly that quite possibly the laziest in New Asgard.” AvengersEndgame ,1

We are watching the complete unraveling of a mind. Spirally into insanity. This is better than the JokerMovie trumppresser,2
I watched DarkPhoenix last night and it was better than I expected (because I had seen some of the bad reviews it got) though definitely not nearly as good as all the other recent X-Men movies. Overall I thought it was worth watching.,0
The more I reread the more I feel Butler’s ParableoftheSower is a fitting companion to UsMovie: a meditation on the pain and exhaustion of constantly defending your survival even your humanity the moral dangers of the struggle and the practical impossibilities of stopping.,0

Signs of the industry's comic book movie overload: DarkPhoenix had to refilm its ending because CaptainMarvel already used the Skrulls. Until going on a random cooking show w/Jon Favreau Gwyneth Paltrow legitimately didn't know she is in Spider-Man: Homecoming.,0

DarkPhoenix I liked it but it felt a bit underwhelming like they were just trying to find a way to end the X-Men series and it wasn't very faithful to the source material (which I read last week so it was fresh in my mind). They didn't even have the Hellfire club.,0

The nicest thing I can say about CatsMovie is that it’s not the worst movie I’ve seen this year but boy was it close. The visual effects are maybe the worst ever for a big budget movie though,0
Just returned from DarkPhoenix and I can confirm that it is unfortunately the worst of the X-Men movies ,0
CaptainMarvel and UsMovie helped a lackluster 2019 box office rebound according to boxofficemojo ,2

Absolutely loved johnwick2 tonight. Both are brilliant films. Think I'll be seeing that one again! Keanu Reeves is so good! ,2
We're excited for the upcoming release of OnceUponATimeInHollywood and judging by this gif so is Margot Robbie. See it from Wed 14 Aug. ,2
I’m with jasonderulo. CatsMovie is “an incredible brave piece of art.” It’s about accepting outsiders and about finding your place. And there’s such joy in all this incredible singing and dancing. I wish people could be more open to such shameless happiness. unashamedfelinity,0

Russo_Brothers ChrisEvans What do we need to do to get a one shot of Cap returning the Soul Stone and interacting with Red Skull again? PLEASE ThankYou Endgame AvengersEndgame CaptainAmerica,2
DarkPhoenix is alright but it wasn't an X-Men movie. It is a Hollywood movie. The crux of it's failure is the arrogance that someone can create a better X-Men in months when it already has more than half a century of history.,0
I even asked if they have a midnight screening for DarkPhoenix and they told me that for today the film is closed ,0
Just saw UsMovie and I'm going to need a few minutes to register what I saw. Believe the hype for it though. I still need answers though.,0
JokerMovie now playing. Get tickets: ,2
Seeing AvengersEndgame might be more traumatic the second time--hearing some of the dialogue after knowing what's going to happen. I'd still see it again and will buy it when it is released. I'll also just buy a box of tissues and not wear mascara when I watch it.,1

ITChapterTwo turned out to be anything but scary ,1
i freaking cried 4 times while watching Frozen2 it’s so good ,1
Btw watch usmovie for some intense storytelling and some over-acting from Ms. Lupita Nyongo. She should move on from her award-winning performance for 12 years a slave.,2

If I were asked to sum up XMen DarkPhoenix in one word it would be.. abysmal. Not only does it fail to justify its own existence.. the movie does a disservice to both its beloved characters and the actors who portrayed them. It’s a shame this series dies on such a low note.,0

Much as I agree with most all of the reviews of catsmovie - which isn’t so much just bad it actually redefines the very term ‘bad’. I would still rather rewatch it than the utterly atrocious thedanishgirl - Eddie Redmaynes pouty face still makes me angry three years later.,0
I think UsMovie is about how we find agency and how agency works through and against fragmentation. It’s about scales of the body scales of resistance and spaces of exception. More broadly I think the movie is really just about inclusion equality and justice.,2
The UsMovie is wild y’all. Gorgeously shot. Inventive concept. Didn’t love the final twist but still a must-watch for horror-heads IMO.,0

UsMovie was good I guess. You really have to be paying attention to say damn that’s a good movie. If you’re not and you’re just casually watching you won’t enjoy it like I did. Read into it on twitter after and I’m disappointed I didn’t pay more attention.,0
RichardJewell is a bad movie. Good performances but this film goes out of its way to explain exactly why the FBI looked at him (it was the right thing to do) and why the press reported it the way they did (they were right).,0

OnceUponATimeInHollywood is hilarious tender and funlets the audience experience its world and follow its characters rather than a typical plot. Tarantino is simply a master of his craft. The scene at the ranch is one of the best of his entire career. Shout out to the dog ,2
I feel like all the people commenting about the female reporter in RichardJewell have not seen the actual movie because she actually comes off rather sympathetically by the end. Bizarre.,0

Random thought re: UsMovie - I love how the mirroring theme extends to the cinematography/story as allusions to other horror films (i.e. intro to family vacation a sweeping descent à la Shining. Addie’s fear for Jason is not about what’s in the water à la Jaws but on the beach),0

It’s looking like the CatsMovie will not make back its $95 million budget. The film suffered a disastrous opening weekend taking in only $10 million and is currently projected to make between $15-20 million during its cinema run. ,0
The RichardJewell script has a not-remotely-true storyline and everyone should pay attention. ,0

Still not over how good all the actors were in the UsMovie,0
It's really time to pull CatsMovie. It's a utter &amp; complete disaster it was doomed from the start and everyone knows it. Now it has to be edited yet again because of Dame Judi Dench's human hand in a scene &amp; the edited version delivered back to the theaters. Enough already. ,0

"JordanPeele Yes 'UsMovie was a masterpiece but theories now tryna be like ""there were only 3 colored rabbits in the opening scene which is 3 min long and it took me 3 min to eat 3 popcorn that means Jordan is tryna say something omfg"" like wtf ",0
Actually quite enjoyed DarkPhoenix it’s really not as bad as some people are making out. Think my low expectations helped but I thought it was decent and it had some good performances in it. Getting Hans Zimmer definitely helped give it a more epic feel to some of the scenes.,0
My verdict on CatsMovie Cats It was ok but I didn't really get it. 5.5/10. I preferred Les Miserables and Mama Mia.,0

I saw catsmovie and it is bad of course. BUT it has more of a plot than the actual stage musical which has no bad guy kidnapping story just songs about cats and then the cat going to heaven. BUT the musical is also bad and I walked out of it. SO cats in general is bad.,0

That’s sad... he shouldn’t have to do that. People just need to get their thumb out of their asses because the movie was not nearly as bad as people made it seem when they already made up their minds before seeing the movie. Smh... DarkPhoenix XMenMovies,0
DarkPhoenix is not the complete qualitative dumpster fire I was expecting. It contains some committed performances and embraces its comic bookiness. But the film is also messily constructed and directed feeling like it’s trying to cram a trilogy of story into one film.,0
OK y'all I have Thoughts about the CatsMovie Which I will hashtag so you can ignore me if you need to Mostly I enjoyed it. But do not go into this thing somehow thinking it is not deeply deeply weird.,0
AvengersEndgame Tuesday reported gross $12M and total domestic gross $639 Million,1
Yep. That and in a case like the most recent one regarding Usmovie because they think disabled people haven't gotten angry about bad representation by white actors (which we have) they twist that to try and make *us* look bad. It's really pissing me off.,0
frozen frozen2 whiskey bourbon what it takes ,1
It’s fascinating looking at the production history of DarkPhoenix and all of the obstacles it had against it. - First Time Director - Movie was originally intended to be 2 films - Film had to reshoot the 3rd act - Ended up becoming unplanned final entry in the franchise,0
UsMovie is an enjoyable horror film with deep/important subtext but the surface level plot is so full of holes that it's hard to not be disappointed. There's a plot twist that's critical to the subtext but also makes no sense even if you predict it 5 minutes in like I did.,0

Not as epic as a saga finale should be DarkPhoenix still delivers joys. Actions sequences might be scarce but quite entertaining nonetheless. The drama was sufficient enough to conjure melancholy tho didn't have enough oomph to be really moving or memorable. [???½??] ,0

X-Men: Dark Phoenix used it's emptiest characters and it's most overused ideas for a film that just felt pointless. Nightcrawler had the only scene that made my time spent feel worth it at all. The actors AND fans deserved better. 3/10 movies DarkPhoenix,0
Well I did it went to see RichardJewell &amp; it was phenomenal. Not surprising that the media &amp; the FBI had some objections. They don’t exactly come across as good guys but Eastwood doesn’t pull these stories out of thin air. Superb performances too!,0

Hi people who've seen CaptainMarvel I'm real sensitive to loud noise and especially jumpy parts like when it's quiet or suspenseful and then RAH! Here comes something out of nowhere! Do I see it in IMAX or is there stuff that is jumpy and sudden? Thanks! cc hintofspy,2

So DarkPhoenix was good. It didn't suck as many have said. A more concise story than Apocalypse. Some excellent action. Definitely not the best but not the worse either. Don't take my word for it or any critics or social media trolls' words. Go see it for yourself.,0

I’ve learned that jellicle cats are jellicle cats and CatsMovie feels at least 3 times it’s 90 minutes. Idris Elba sans coat and hat is terrifyingly nude Judi Dench’s legs - the most cat like thing in the price are not to be missed. Disturbingly sexual and genuinely odd,0
Despite the lackluster reviews the CatsMovie has received I still want to see it. And to be honest I believe UniversalPics would be looking at much less of a loss had they not chosen the holiday period for its release. The CatsMovie &amp; Winter holidays—NOT a good match. ,0
My issue with the whole Dark Phoenix thing is that in any movie/cartoon the never make me care enough about Jean Grey to care about her evil turn. She comes across more like a plot device than a person. Are the comics different? xmen DarkPhoenix,0

My thoughts on Frozen2 - The story is better than the 1st but the songs aren’t. - Most of it will go over kids’ heads. - Highlights include Olaf’s recap of Frozen &amp; Kristoff’s cheesy 80s-inspired ballad. - Into The Unknown is better in the context of the movie. - You will cry.,1

I really liked DarkPhoenix tbh. It was enjoyable and had a lot of character moments which I prefer over fight scenes. And it had cool fight scenes! Whatever critics.,0
I really enjoyed cats the movie... The set was stunning the music and dancing were beautiful. Jennifer Hudson singing was remarkable. I didn't really like the cgi I felt like they should've done more with makeup and costumes but I enjoyed everything else. CatsMovie,0
Went to see UsMovie tonight...it was good but it got me on my thoughts,0
How many time I can see Already many times If I go again My dad will become thanos AvengersEndgame,1
Now let's talk about CatsMovie. I couldn't wait to see it because of all the bad reviews. I wanted to see how bad it was. Tbh it wasn't terrible at all. Dare I say I found it mostly enjoyable. It didn't make me want to kill myself for the entire duration like TRoS did.,0
You’ve really gotta see a film like UsMovie again knowing the twist. You see motive you see subtext you see creative choices and direction from knowing the truth. The subtle little things! It’s a completely different film the second time. Unreal.,2

I have to sleep but all I can say about CatsMovie is oof It's like wanting to suspend your disbelief and then getting slapped in the face immediately after for hoping this movie that takes itself too seriously would take itself so seriously.,0
Can’t wait to see it when it hits Pay per View. I’m disabled and can’t go out to see it. Nothing could be as bad as LaLa Land. I was too young to see Cats in the theatre but I’ll certainly watch this. I’d go to an envelope opening for most of these stars CatsMovie,0
OnceUponATimeInHollywood is cool...awesome 60s vibe then....boom ,2
Good for him. He reminds me of RichardJewell — not particularly winsome in personality but falsely accused. That’s un-American ,0

So yes ppl go see it even if you're not a superhero kinda ppl you will like this one CaptainMarvel &amp; of course the after credit scenes are important &amp; more the last one we finally know where that thing was hiding all this time ,2

So can we count on the same level of fictionalization of the character of the people in the ComeyMovie that you gave us in RichardJewell? Cuz if so I'd rather not waste my time or money.,0
I saw OnceUponATimeInHollywood yesterday with my sister and IMO it was great. It’s essentially a love letter to the actors and stuntmen during the dying days of Hollywood’s Golden Age and an alternate take of the death of the 60s. The cast and setting was great also. Go See It. ,2

Went to see XMenMovies DarkPhoenix The bad reviews are definitely exaggerated. Was it perfect? No but calling it terrible is disingenuous. Enjoyed the SFX &amp; fight scenes. Let down that fox didn't give it the grand finale it deserved before it goes to the MCU,0

"Why does everyone calling it ""Kinberg cut""? The theatrical cut is his full vision. This is not the Snyder/Whedon Justice League situation where someone else took the movie and killed it. Yes Fox changed some plans but it was ONLY Kinbergs decision to cut 30mins of DarkPhoenix ",0
Big fan superhero movies here but I feel DarkPhoenix was totally unnecessary. It's a poor tribute to the Claremont &amp; Byrne story and adds nothing to The Last Stand. Visually meritorious main characters out of character bland and generic villains and notorious close ups abuse.,0
Loved OnceUponATimeInHollywood best Tarantino movie since KillBill And yeah Pitt is awesome in it some of his best stuff since FightClub It's so satisfying to see my boy Quentin back in form almost as satisfying as (mild spoiler ahead...........................) that ending,2

DarkPhoenix was a dissapointing ending to the X-men franchise . The story was horrid the pacing was weird. I felt like the actors didn't even want to be filming as their performances felt unenthusiastic. Still kudos to everyone who was involved in the movie!,0
so i WENT OUT (i cannot emphasize it enough) and watched DarkPhoenix. VFX 10/10 Music 10/10 (Hans Zimmer) Story/Plot 3/10 (Very mediocre your run of the mill superhero shit),0
In USmovie JordanPeele balances light-and-dark framing in ways that recall Kubrick &amp; Hitchcock. GetOut does this too: not chiaroscuro precisely but a subconscious CONSTANT visual indicator of how degrees of darkness permeate the stories he is telling.,0

So madly in love with this awesome Minnie Riperton song Les Fleurs after it ran over the closing credits of UsMovie However impossible to sing over in the car unless like the icon herself you have a five octave vocal range. ,2
I think one main “flaws” was the score. There is “epic” sounding music playing through the whole movie and I felt like that took away from the scenes that were meant to be emotional. And that’s a big deal to me I look for movies to move/draw me in emotionally. DarkPhoenix,0

Morons and agenda from both sides are why it failed. Dark Phoenix is damn good period. Judge it on its own merit and it's flawed but entertaining. Anyone that says otherwise either has an agenda or extremely poor taste in film. darkphoenix,0

Just listened to the movie soundtrack for CatsMovie and I gotta say my favorite track has to be “Macavity” performed by taylorswift13. Hearing her performance gave me MAJOR Jessica Rabbit vibes,0
DarkPhoenix does NOT suck like critics are saying! Sure the villains sucked due to poor explanation and character development but at least the film was better than X-Men Apolcalypse and the original Jean Grey storyline (IMO). McAvoy and Fassbender are fantastic as always.,0

The MCU has the support of kids and families but that doesn’t mean their films are immature. They appeal to wide demographics. XMen can still be serious under them w/ an added dose of fun. But they wouldn’t have made films like DarkPhoenix or Logan. I appreciate the foXmen .,0

I mean pretty much myself and everyone I know thought DarkPhoenix looked ropey. But for an XMen film to look likely to NOT gross more than $100mill in America proves that nothing is guaranteed if it’s mis-managed.,0

DarkPhoenix I don't understan the bad reviews Its not the “end of a cycle” like they tride to convince us (that was Logan) is another chapter but isn’t a bad chaptet. I think maybe the last X-Men chapter should have been DaysOfFuturePast and Logan after that. Recommendable,0

I recall the RichardJewell saga. But the movie script &amp; Wilde &amp; Hamm's OTT acting didn't help what could've been compelling drama. And that's on Clint Eastwood. Felt he used a specific tragedy/fuckup to bash all media &amp; govt. Hauser was good as he has been in other films.,0

After all the talk concerns and some fabricated stories from members of the media trying to stir up discussion for the sake of clicks JokerMovie has surpassed $500M worldwide in just two weeks. ,1
We just went to see UsMovie and I’m a little scared to look in a mirror now. But it’s all worth it to have seen Lupita_Nyongo deliver a simultaneously fantastic and terrifying performance.,0
James Corden is in it as Bustopher Jones he basically sings a song about being fat which doesn't win any awards for originality. HOWEVER he IS very charismatic on screen & I've seen him in a musical before & surprisingly that genre seems to really suit him...CatsMovie,0
CaptainMarvel was terrible.,1
UsMovie was amazing. JordanPeele is now an auto watch for me. It doesn't matter what it is he does next but I am going to be there to see it.,0
Kinberg question about DarkPhoenix why were characters insistent about calling each other by their given names instead of their mutant character names? I mean except Storm who was referred to as Storm Calling Mystique “Raven” CONSTANTLY was jarring.,0
My kid brother really love Keanu Now I seriously want this movie to released so he can stop talking abt it! Good Luck JW Team JohnWick2,1

I watch a lot of Movies especially Sci-fi..And I have pretty much watched almost all of XmenMovies DarkPhoenix lack depth yes. But it wasn't a Bad Movie so I don't know why so many critics about the movie. I think they did better than average other XMEN movie including Logan,0

ITChapterTwo. Bit like the original to be honest the 2nd part not as good as the 1st.,1
Dark Phoenix - I liked this movie better when it was called Monsters vs. Aliens. X-Men: The Last Stand is superior and makes this film unnecessary. Competing blasts of powerful beams don't constitute drama. We've seen these character debates ad nauseam. 4 Avoid. -J DarkPhoenix ,0

OnceUponATimeInHollywood is sadly not the strongest Quentin Tarantino flick if I'm being perfectly blunt with you all. It's obviously well directed great cast good performances with a standout being Leonardo DiCaprio in a role that will undoubtedly get him an Oscar nomination. ,2

CatsMovie guys !!! no need to update the movie we just don’t want it !!!,0
Pretty sure my favorite thing about OnceUponATimeInHollywood is the fact that no one can decide where the ellipses in the title goes including the people who made the movie. (It's two different ways on the website!) ,2
No definite cause for such disorder but theories on why people develop it makes complete sense for Red’s character!! This is just plain dumb and a major reach. Just say you’re racist or a misogynist or both and go USmovie ,2

"I don't know if this is was intentional but either way it's amazing: Jay Leno said in 1996 that Richard Jewell ""had a scary resemblance to the guy who whacked Nancy Kerrigan."" RichardJewell star Paul Walter Hauser played Shawn Eckardt who attacked Kerrigan in ""I Tonya.""",0

Billy Ray and the other writers of RichardJewell the films director Clint Eastwood and Warner Brothers don't care about the truth. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution cared about the truth and still does. Here is the truth. ,0
Listen if you didn't know CatsMovie was going to be an absolute nightmare you either didn't pay attention to the trailers or didn't pay attention to the stage production. In any event new CG isn't going to fix what's wrong with it nor will it fix the brains of Cats fans.,0

It's been a rollercoaster year in movies for comic book fans. Incredible highs (CaptainMarvel might-just-make-it-to-all-time-highest-grossing AvengersEndgame) and dreadful lows (DarkPhoenix Hellboy). (I am so bummed about the latter but that's another thread.),0
DarkPhoenix had lots of wasted potential. Sad thing is I like Sophie Turner as Jean Grey. Very few stakes. A lot of talk about how dangerous Jean is without ever showing it much. Jessica Chastain’s talent was underused. The music was phenomenal. Train sequence was great. [C-] ,0

So I saw DarkPhoenix. I know the critics don't like it but I really enjoyed it. I thought Sophie Turner did a great job as Jean Grey. Unfortunately this movie really doesn't tie in well with the other X-Men movies but I liked it as a stand alone film. I liked it more than X3,0

FOR THE RECORD DarkPhoenix is the superior Marvel movie this year (so far). 2hrs of NON-STOP ACTION. Everyone got their chance to use their powers together. Some of the casting is off and the dialogue was basic but it did enough. 6/10. Endgame only had action at the end. ,0
MRW CatsMovie didn't cast a single person who has spent thousands of dollars on body modification to look like a cat-human hybrid and people are acting like that isn't blatant cultural appropriation. Be better Tom Hopper. ,0

the best part of JokerMovie was when I watched two Scorsese films beforehand,2
DarkPhoenix well it definitely was sabotaged. I get that. But no matter for what reason. It would still be a horrible film. The actress looks nothing like Jean Gray and can't act. Also the first marvel movie starring a female superhero is Red Sonja period. ,0
My niece begged me to see a horror movie before she went back to school from the holiday break. She wanted to go see .catsmovie. We left after 10 minutes. This is what happens when Hollywood believes their own bullshit. Who do I ask for a refund??? CatsMovie,0

Not a huge Eastwood fan but its a shame RJewellFilm is performing poorly. Saw it over the weekend; one of the better films I've seen recently. Showed a lot about media hysteria / trial by the public can do. Sam Rockwell was great also (shout out to Daly City). RichardJewell,0

Not really interested in relitigating the whole spoiler debate re: UsMovie (and to be clear critics should be allowed to write whatever the hell they want in reviews) but I will say that there's a shot in the trailer lifted from the film's final minutes that's unforgivable.,0

If I had to champion one film this year it wouldn't be Shazam Godzilla or Alita. It'd be DarkPhoenix. I thought SimonKinberg did an admirable job for a first time director made up for the horrendous TheLastStand &amp; didn't try to ape the MCU. It was a nice chamber piece.,0
Cats is very good at being disturbing! I had no idea where to look! It’s unfortunate as the music in this film is pretty good! It’s a shame the same can’t be said of the rest of the film! Cats is in a few words uncomfortably musical! CatsMovie CatsTheMovie,0

So DarkPhoenix 7/10 is way better than InfinityWar 6/10. The FEMALE existential angst of Jean Grey as DarkPhoenix is more substantial more heart-felt &amp; more relatable than the MASCULINE outrageous angst of Thanos. DarkPhoenix is the world's greatest anti-hero NOT Thanos!,0

I see the “YOU JUST DIDNT GET IT” UsMovie defenders out in full force tell me how do you respect a movie that didn’t respect its own twist? *SPOILER* Why would she say she was sad with her reaction in the funhouse when they first met if she wasn’t the original Red?,0

The JokerMovie was incredible. In my opinion it lived up to all the hype. Really can’t say enough good things about it. Superb. ,1
Again the media has succeeded in taking attention away from the real story their public prosecution and persecution of RichardJewell and made the story all about them and how they are victims. The story is NOT about how Scrugg got her info; it’s about how Jewell got screwed,0

Unfortunately this is completely true and part of why RichardJewell is so upsetting to me. It denies our very real experiences on the job and warp it into falsehoods. And guess what people will choose to believe? ,0
In the final calculus DarkPhoenix is a messy undeserved conclusion to a franchise that had such great promise after the twin successes of First Class and DOFP. But it’s certainly not devoid of redeeming qualities either qualities that would not be apparent in the MCU formula.,0
Seeing ITChapterTwo &amp; I’m a little lazy at the fact that it’s three hours long. I hope it’s worth it. If not at least I get to see Bill Hader on the big screen.,1

JokerMovie began to significantly lose screens today in Indonesia (Maleficent 2) and some more tomorrow (Perempuan Tanah Jahanam). However I think the 3rd week drop still won't be as big as the norm for Hollywood tentpoles. We'll see Sunday night. ,2
So DarkPhoenix was not nearly as bad as the hate it's getting. Yes the action sequences were bad and incoherent and yes it makes no sense in the FoX-Men continuity. But the score was great acting actually wasn't half bad and it *tried* to approach some interesting issues.,0

But you go to Cats (on stage) for beautiful dancing I guess. And it's a shame they couldn't bring that to the CatsMovie (with some notable exceptions) because if you don't have that....well you're just left with the concept of Cats. Which I think I've made clear is whackadoo.,0

...I knew it! JokerMovie ,1
The part of the JokerMovie that really spoke to me was the absolute breakdown of Arthur’s social and mental support system. This movie is a great piece about why we NEED mental health programs. His violence directly follows the lack of (albeit shitty) therapy and access to meds. ,1

I saw Cats on broadway as a kid and I thought it was horrible. CatsMovie sounds even worse somehow and I am 110% going to go watch it in theatres thanks to BOGO virgin mobile offers biweekly,0
Attitudes about June and February releases sure did turn on a dime. But I don't blame DarkPhoenix I blame the people who forced reshoots (raising the budget) and then started throwing other people and movies under the bus when Phoenix opened low. Were the reshoots worth it? ,0
I saw Cats and loved it! I’ve seen it on and off Broadway. Why it’s panned by critics I have no idea. Great voices cool special effects vibrant scenery amazing actors. It’s the musical on screen. What’s not to like? CatsMovie catsreview,0

I’ve seen the CatsMovie now and I must say I do NOT hate it as much as everyone seems to do. The only things I can say is that I though they cut too much of the original lyrics and added too many “meows” where not needed. Also I love Judy Dench but she did not suit her role.,0

(1/3) Can someone us an honest thought piece on CatsMovie From what I can tell it seems as though someone reveals that to their surprise all the cats had a fixation on dying...and being sexual AF. Humans act like they are the only creatures that fuck for pleasure. Do cats?,0
I really do feel like DarkPhoenix was rushed and should have been broken up to at least 3 films max because of the rich details it brought to comicbook fans. Also can someone for the love of god tell me or show me the correct timeline for xmen hahaha i think i got but not sure.,0
I personally felt that JohnWick2 was better than the first one. Here is my review  ,2
Frozen2 is haunting me in a good way. I wanna see it again. It offered something the original didn't and that's that it left me beyond satisfied and happy. Kudos to the creative team for taking the risks and creating a sequel that evolves the universe in a wonderful way. ,1

My mom referred to her cat’s paws as “hands” yesterday. The CatsMovie has embedded itself into our psyches and cursed us all,0
One word description of Joker: boring. It was excellently produced the acting was great and its anti-egalitarian message was likely behind the media's disdain for it. I recommend watching it once it comes out on a streaming platform. Not worth it in theaters. JokerMovie,1
Off to see DarkPhoenix tomorrow night but not sure what's happening Saturday yet,0
My review for JokerMovie ! ,2
At the movies with my friends friends UsMovie,2
Joaquin Phoenix was phenomenal!!!! Amazing!!!! You really saw his deterioration into madness loved the film JokerMovie,2
went to see frozen 2 last night really njoyed it 4 what it was are the songs gonna be as good as the first 1 no butt its still a good disney adventure to go on i ll always have a soft spot 4 the oringnal tho Frozen2 ,1
Dragging my homeboy with me to see DarkPhoenix tomorrow. He isn’t aware though. This should be fun.,0

For a movie pretty much made for people who love Hollywood (& LA) the driving routes in OnceUponATimeInHollywood were completely nonsensical. You think we can’t recognize Forest Lawn and where the 134 meets the 101?!C’monnnn Tarantino we’re CALIFORNIANS! ,2

here's some of the symbols and metaphors and easter eggs and whatnot in UsMovie because JordanPeele is a genius and i applaud him  (contains spoilers!!!),2

just finished watching CatsMovie and genuinely never wanted to bash my head into a wall so much in my life,0
I had no intentions of seeing CatsMovie but after reading this review I feel this is the purfect way to end the decade. ,0
Cats has a 2.6 IMDB rating. Even shitty horror movies aren’t rated that low. catsfail catsmovie noonelikedtheplay badmemories sos,0
So RichardJewell was a fine movie BUT reading up on Kathy Scruggs it does make me feel that they shouldn't have made up aspects of her character for the sake of the story. I feel there is a way to hold the media's feet to the fire without making up a narrative.,0
I need xtina version of ShowYourself let’s be honest here. Frozen2,1
I just got back from watching DarkPhoenix and particular deaths aside I liked it well enough. (Tbh i can't understand what all the fuss was about with people bitching about it it's Literally the Same Ol' Brand of X-Men movie if you ask me.),0
JordanPeele's UsMovie final twist is so predictable I saw it coming a mile away. Then again I think that was the intent.,0
Something I DID like about johnwick2 - the soundtrack. Pretty powerful stuff.,2
Omgd. I am completely remiss: DarkPhoenix was fucking amazing. Storm is forever a Living Goddess. And Jean Grey the most powerful existence on Earth peaked. The paid movie critics (again 94% white and male) do not know what they are talking about.,0
what Joaquin Phoenix really needed though was a big thick mustache JokerMovie,1
 SPOILER ALERT STOP READING IF YOU DIDNT WATCH DarkPhoenix YET Someone please explain to me how raven and jean died if the older versions of them were alive in all the x men movies based after dark Phoenix?? Does marvel really not give a shit about x men’s chronology?,0
Evening with CaptainMarvel Finally! ,2
They fucked up twice I repeat FUCKING TWICE the DarkPhoenix Storyline! And the worst of it it’s that FUCKING X3 is even a little better in pace in story and even at the final battle!!!!!,0

"DarkPhoenix director Simon Kinberg reflects on the film's underwhelming box office performance: ""It clearly didn't connect with audiences that didn't see it it didn't connect enough with those that did see it. That's on me. I loved making it I loved the people I made it with."" ",0

Seriously... if DjangoUnchained ended somehow at the Candie Ranch before the silly shootout it instantly jumps a few places up the chart. Looking forward to seeing OnceUponATimeInHollywood as soon as I can. (Stupid split release schedule).,2
Disney's release of Fox's DarkPhoenix cratered in its 2nd weekend dropping a massive -72.6% for an estimated $9M 3-day and a domestic gross that now tops $51M. This is the 2nd largest 2nd weekend drop for a film playing in over 3500 theaters in its 2nd weekend. [BOM],0
In honor of EmileHirsch being great in OnceUponATimeInHollywood I am here to remind you that SpeedRacer is a great movie Spectacular visuals great acting beautiful story and it elevates the source material to a new level Just watch it you won’t regret it,2
I was satisfied with the theatrical cut of DarkPhoenix but we all know how frustrating it is when there’s a better alternative more fleshed out version of the movie out there. Hope they release it somewhere down the line. ,0

DarkPhoenix I had mixed feelings about this movie. I cried too. It feels undercooked considering what happened during the production. But it wasn't awful. It's pretty darn amazing actually. And I love this one just as much as DOFP. The action sequence for Erik was mindblowing. ,0

"Watched ""It Chapter Two"" (starring Jessica Chastain James McAvoy &amp; Bill Hader). Very good movie but it was too long- Pause (2 hr 49 min). ITChapter2 ITChapterTwo",1
Saw DarkPhoenix today. It was alright in my opinion. I don’t know why people hate it. Most don’t know this was the final film that Fox will make since Disney owns the license now. It ended the way it did cuz of that. ¯\_(?)_/¯ XMEN,0
Overall... DarkPhoenix was not good. Better than Last Stand though. There were a few things I liked! 1. I did enjoy them tackling Xavier's hubris I feel like that happens a good amount in the comics and appreciated that part. 2. Finally seeing Genosha. 3. Dazzler! (1/2),0

Finally went to see the JokerMovie &amp; I gave me goosebumps. Fantastic acting beautiful cinematography and an outstanding back story to the Joker. We really see how he ended up the way he is. It lined up so well with Bruce's origin I thought it was really well done. ,2
I'm so confused. The opening number doesn't make sense. What the fuck is a Jellicle (sp?) Cat. Is it a breed? CatsMovie,0

Ppl are talking about the snub of RichardJewell but I'm not surprised. I think it's quite good with one glaring flaw but it's not a top-five drama. No-name star and Clint's stealth campaign approach may have backfired. Also attempts to read politics into non-political film.,0
The Henry Bowers subplot in ITChapterTwo really wasn’t needed tbh.,1

So I just watched DarkPhoenix. It isn't great but in no way does it deserve the 22% RT score it has. It was no where near as bad as some ppl were making it out to be. CGI was fine just a poor story and not enough explanation. 5/10 for me for now ,0
CatsTheMovie CatsMovie always knew this would be a strange one as the stage-show itself was a little bizarre but never did I expect these cats to be so terrifying. Why do they have human hands and features?! Nightmare worthy. On the up side singing and sets are great! 2/10 ,0
